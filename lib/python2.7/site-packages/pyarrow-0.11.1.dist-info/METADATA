## Python library for Apache Arrow

This library provides a Python API for functionality provided by the Arrow C++
libraries, along with tools for Arrow integration and interoperability with
pandas, NumPy, and other software in the Python ecosystem.

## Installing

Across platforms, you can install a recent version of pyarrow with the conda
package manager:

```shell
conda install pyarrow -c conda-forge
```

On Linux/macOS and Windows, you can also install binary wheels from PyPI with pip:

```shell
pip install pyarrow
```

## Development

### Coding Style

We follow a similar PEP8-like coding style to the [pandas project][3].

The code must pass `flake8` (available from pip or conda) or it will fail the
build. Check for style errors before submitting your pull request with:

```
flake8 .
flake8 --config=.flake8.cython .
```

### Building from Source

See the [Development][2] page in the documentation.

### Building the documentation

```bash
pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
python setup.py build_sphinx -s doc/source
```
